# VMs-For-PAHS-Cybersecurity-and-Computer-Forensics-Class
Scripts and VMs used to create and maintain the lab environment for Port Angeles High School's Cybersecurity and Computer Forensics classes.  Lab directions, assignments, and videos can be found at http://cybersecurity.portangelesschools.org

<b>createPools.sh</b> - used to create the resource pools for the students.  Each student is manually assigned a resource pool by giving the select permissions to that student on that resource pool.

<b>addperms.sh</b> - finds next available resource pool and assigns it to the user read from the file user.txt

<b>removeperms.sh</b> - removes all the student permissions from the resource pools - this is done to start a new school year!

<b>manvms.sh</b> - the main script that creates copies of the vms; resets them to the original snapshot; and can delete, poweron, poweroff machines.  The script is menu driven.  I do send much info the screen.  I like to see what is going on.

The actual vms used are:
